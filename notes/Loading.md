# Loading UI
> - This file allows us to create loading states that are displayed to users while
specific route segment's content is loading
> - The loading state appears immediately upon navigation, giving users the
assurance that the application is responsive and actively loading content

### Benefit of using loading.tsx file

> 1. You can display the loading state as soon as a user navigates to a new route
> 2. The immediate feedback reassures users that their action has been
acknowledged, reduces perceived loading times, and makes the application
feel more responsive.
Next.js allows the creation of shared layouts that remain interactive while new
route segments are loading
> 3. Users can continue interacting with certain parts of the application, such as a
navigation menu or sidebar, even if the main content is still being fetched
